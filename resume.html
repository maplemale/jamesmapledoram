        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Director: Product — Consumer Direct Care Network</h3>
        <p><em>Missoula, MT | Jan 2023 – Present</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lead the product vision and roadmap for transforming CDCN’s legacy caregiver and member portal into a modern,
            mobile-first experience, including navigation redesign, new shift entry and approval flows, and stronger
            alignment with CDCN’s brand and accessibility goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secured executive alignment for a multi-year modernization initiative, recruited UX/UI designers, and
            established a long-term cross-functional partnership model spanning PMO, Customer Experience, Quality,
            Engineering, and Marketing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worked with Marketing to formalize brand guidelines, improve accessibility of colors and components, and
            ensure the updated portal and public sites present a consistent, professional, and user-centered experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Directed a phased modernization strategy using a hybrid strangler approach: redesigned high-value, high-traffic
            workflows as new greenfield experiences while lift-shifting lower-use areas to ensure continuity for
            hundreds of thousands of users across multiple states.
          </li>
          <li>
            Established basic observability and auditability (App Insights, usage telemetry, and data-layer logging) to
            support monitoring and compliance—capabilities that previously did not meaningfully exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduced a scalable multi-lingual framework for the portal, replacing hard-coded translations with a
            vendor-supported model covering 13 languages and laying the groundwork for future integration with an
            enterprise translation management system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early outcomes include a measurable increase in mobile usage, stable call-center volume through rollout,
            consistent shift submission behavior, and a significantly more maintainable, brand-consistent platform
            positioned for ongoing accessibility and UX improvements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initiated and led modernization of CDCN’s public websites, bringing them under shared Product/Engineering/Marketing
            governance, defining a hybrid WordPress + HubSpot strategy, and improving content velocity and analytics for
            campaigns and events.
          </li>
          <li>
            Played a key role in shaping CDCN’s multi-year MFA strategy: defined shared ownership between Security and
            Product, participated in vendor selection, and led product discovery and UX definition for SMS- and
            email-based factors and phased rollout plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Championed AI-augmented workflows across Product, UX, and Design, defining reusable, source-controlled AI agents
            grounded in CDCN context and enabling teams to move faster on research synthesis, story-writing, and content
            iteration while preserving human oversight.
          </li>
        </ul>
