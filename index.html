        <h2>Product Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User-centric, empathy and outcome-driven:</strong>
            Start with the job-to-be-done and align roadmaps to measurable business outcomes.
            Carry that focus down into the backlog by writing work items and stories that link user value
            to delivery tasks, so developers always see the “why” behind the “what.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empowered by AI & modern tools:</strong>
            Use AI and automation to enhance discovery, design, and delivery—freeing teams
            to focus on creativity, insight, and solving the hardest problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lean, Agile, and DevOps excellence:</strong>
            Favor small, focused teams; apply lean-agile principles to reduce waste and accelerate
            learning; and reinforce CI/CD discipline with telemetry-driven decisions that shorten
            feedback loops and reduce risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>People first:</strong>
            Empower individuals to grow their skills and careers in ways that also create long-term
            value for the company—aligning personal development with organizational success.

			<p class="summary">
			  Engineering leader with 20+ years of experience designing and scaling SaaS platforms in cloud-native environments.
			  I lead teams that care deeply about code quality, reliability, and operability—pairing solid architecture with pragmatic execution.
			  I’ve built and evolved CI/CD pipelines, observability practices, and DevOps cultures that let teams ship quickly without sacrificing stability.
			  I love mentoring engineers, untangling hard technical problems, and partnering with product to turn complex requirements into simple, robust systems.

      <section class="philosophy">
		  <h2>Engineering Leadership Strategy</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li>
			  <strong>Grow developers into senior developers:</strong>
			  My core mission as an engineering leader is mentorship. I invest deeply in technical maturity—helping developers
			  grow judgment, autonomy, and architectural thinking. When teams level up, the entire organization gains leverage.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>Defensible, self-documenting, maintainable code:</strong>
			  I emphasize code that is readable, consistent, and easy to reason about. Patterns, naming, and structure should
			  *explain themselves*, reducing onboarding time, increasing reliability, and preventing knowledge silos.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>Architect for extensibility and separation of concerns:</strong>
			  I advocate for modular, domain-driven patterns where systems are designed around the core model of the real-world
			  business. Clean separation between domains, services, and concerns enables rapid change without system fragility.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>API-first, architecture-first delivery:</strong>
			  Great engineering starts with modeling the system—not screens or workflows. I prioritize stable domain models,
			  contract-driven APIs, and well-defined integration boundaries so that user interfaces and product experiences
			  become simpler, faster, and safer to build.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>AI-empowered engineering, not rule-based orchestration:</strong>
			  Modern platforms go beyond static business rules. I focus on integrating AI agents and automated decision systems
			  that reduce operational load, improve accuracy, and unlock new product capabilities through adaptive intelligence.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>Analytics-ready system design:</strong>
			  Systems should serve the business at every layer. I design DALs and service boundaries with reporting,
			  observability, auditability, and governance in mind—so analytics are not an afterthought but a first-class feature.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>Lean, Agile, and DevOps excellence:</strong>
			  Teams should estimate honestly, build passionately, and deploy safely with minimal ceremony. I champion CI/CD
			  pipelines, trunk-based development, test automation, and telemetry-driven engineering that supports fast,
			  stable, sustainable delivery.
			</li>

			<li>
			  <strong>Team autonomy and end-to-end ownership:</strong>
			  Inspired by <em>Team Topologies</em>, I believe in stream-aligned teams with clear mission boundaries, minimal
			  handoffs, and full lifecycle ownership—from design through operations. Autonomy creates focus; focus accelerates
			  value.
			</li>
