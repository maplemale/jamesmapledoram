              <h3>“Direct My Care” Portal — Mobile-First Redesign & Modernization</h3>
              <p><em>Director of Systems, CDCN · 2023–Present</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Led the full product vision and roadmap for transforming CDCN’s legacy caregiver and member portal into a modern, mobile-first experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secured executive alignment for a multi-year modernization initiative, recruited UX/UI designers, and
                  established a long-term cross-functional partnership model spanning PMO, Customer Experience, Quality,
                  Engineering, and Marketing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked with Marketing to formalize brand guidelines, improve
                  accessibility of colors and components, and ensure the updated portal aligned with CDCN’s broader public
                  web presence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Directed a phased modernization strategy using a hybrid strangler approach: redesigned the highest-value,
                  highest-traffic workflows as new greenfield experiences while lift-shifting lower-use areas to ensure continuity
                  for hundreds of thousands of users across multiple states.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Established basic observability and auditability (App Insights, usage telemetry, and data-layer logging) to
                  support monitoring and compliance—capabilities that previously did not meaningfully exist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introduced a scalable multi-lingual framework for the portal, replacing hard-coded translations with a vendor-supported
                  model covering 13 languages. Established the foundation for future integration with an enterprise translation management
                  system through collaboration with Marketing and Enterprise Architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Early outcomes include a measurable increase in mobile usage, stable call-center volume through rollout,
                  consistent shift submission behavior, and a significantly more maintainable, brand-consistent platform
                  positioned for ongoing accessibility and UX improvements.

              <h3>Public Website Modernization & HubSpot Integration</h3>
              <p><em>Director of Systems, CDCN · 2023–Present</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Initiated and led a modernization strategy for CDCN’s network of public websites—historically owned solely by
                  Marketing—transforming them into jointly governed digital assets that support onboarding, communication, and
                  user-facing education.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Established the first sustained partnership between Product, Engineering, and Marketing for public-facing
                  websites, aligning brand, content strategy, UX, accessibility, and technical stewardship under shared goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collaborated with Marketing to refresh brand guidelines and introduce accessible color, layout, and component
                  standards that now apply consistently across CDCN’s public web presence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Defined a hybrid CMS strategy using WordPress for structural content and HubSpot for engagement, analytics,
                  and lead management. Oversaw implementation of event tracking and a new custom registration calendar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guided design and development teams through a coordinated rollout, beginning with the national website and
                  expanding toward a unified ecosystem of 13+ state and program sites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Outcomes include a more secure, brand-consistent public presence, improved content velocity for Marketing,
                  and clearer visibility into user behavior and engagement.

              <h3>MFA Strategy, Governance & Rollout Planning</h3>
              <p><em>Director of Systems, CDCN · 2023–Present</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Played a key role in shaping CDCN’s multi-year MFA strategy, working with Security, Product, and business
                  leadership to balance stronger account protection with the realities of a large, diverse caregiver and member
                  population.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Helped define ownership boundaries between Security and Product—establishing governance, decision rights, and a
                  shared roadmap instead of treating MFA as a one-time “IT project.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participated in vendor selection and advocated for a configurable, buy-and-integrate approach over building
                  everything in-house, with a focus on long-term maintainability and flexibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Led product discovery and UX definition for MFA enrollment and challenge flows, including requirements gathering,
                  wireframes, and Figma designs for SMS and email-based factors as the initial focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked through cross-cutting questions such as where to roll out MFA first, how to prioritize channels,
                  how users maintain their contact information, and how to communicate changes with minimal disruption to customer
                  support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The resulting plan emphasizes a phased rollout, SMS- and email-first factors, clear user communication, and a
                  foundation that can support additional risk-based and event-triggered protections over time.
                </li>

                  Introduced AI tools and patterns into Product, UX, and Design workflows to accelerate discovery, research
                  synthesis, story-writing, and content iteration—while keeping humans accountable for decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Defined reusable, source-controlled AI agents grounded in CDCN context to reduce one-off prompts and
                  improve outcome consistency and governance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reduced friction in early-stage work (drafts, alternatives, summaries), allowing teams to spend more time
                  on prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and higher-order design.

          <h3>Professional Portfolio (JamesMapledoram.com)</h3>
          <p>
            A fully custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript portfolio built in partnership with AI. I designed the site structure,
            architectural patterns, and interaction model, then leveraged ChatGPT for rapid code generation, component
            scaffolding, and debugging. This project demonstrates my ability to pair senior-level engineering literacy with
            modern AI tooling — building faster, cleaner, and more creatively while still understanding every line of code
            that runs in production.

          <h3>FHEGGS — Multi-Vendor Farm-to-Farm Marketplace</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://fheggs.com" target="_blank">fheggs.com</a> ·
            <a href="https://fheggs.10web.cloud/#" target="_blank">UAT Site</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            A farm-to-farm, multi-vendor marketplace for fertilized hatching eggs, built with my wife using the 10Web
            platform. The hatching egg community largely relies on platforms where live-animal or fertility-related sales
            are discouraged or prohibited, making this a novel solution focused on legitimacy, quality, and consistency.
            I selected the underlying platform, plugins, and extensibility model; designed the information architecture;
            and ensured scalability for future vendor onboarding, listing governance, and customer communication. This
            project blends product strategy, platform selection, UX decisions, and light engineering to create a
            pre-launch marketplace with strong early interest.

          <h3>torqueRight (“What the Torque?”) — Mobile App for Mechanics</h3>
          <p>
            A pre-AI mobile application I built independently to give home and small-shop mechanics quick access to bolt
            torque specifications — not engine torque, but the precise pressure required to safely tighten specific bolts
            during vehicle repair. I wrote a multi-threaded data extraction service that pulled specifications from
            official sources, stored them in a locally indexed SQLite database, and shipped a Xamarin Forms application
            with offline and online modes. While the app is now sunset, it was a deep dive into mobile development,
            data processing, and building a clean UX for a niche but highly technical audience.
